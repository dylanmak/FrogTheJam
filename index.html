Hi there, my name is Frog the Jam. I'm a slime creature with a frog's head that croaks as I attack. 
I live in the swamps of the Dark Forest, and I'm feared by all the other creatures that live here.
People say a lot of things about me. Some say I'm a guardian of the swamp, 
protecting it from outsiders, while others believe I'm a force of chaos and destruction. 
</p>

<p>
Honestly, I'm not sure what to believe myself. All I know is that I'm just trying to survive in this harsh world.
I don't get many visitors in the swamp, but when I do, they usually don't stick around for long. 
I can't blame them, I'm not exactly the most welcoming creature around. But if you're brave enough to venture into my territory, 
be warned: those who dare to cross paths with me do so at their own risk. 

</p>

<p>
Just remember, if you hear a loud croaking noise, it's probably me.

            <dt>My backstory</dt>
            <dd><p>Frog the Jam was a strange and unusual creature. It was a slimy, green blob with a frog's head and long, spindly arms. Despite its odd appearance, Frog the Jam was a powerful and formidable monster in the world of card games.</p>

                <p>However, Frog the Jam was heavily discriminated against by the other frogs in its world. It was constantly teased and excluded, with other frogs saying things like &quot;except Frog the Jam&quot; whenever they made plans or played games.</p>
                
                <p>Frog the Jam tried its best to ignore the discrimination and focus on becoming the best monster card it could be. It practiced tirelessly, determined to prove to the other frogs that it was just as skilled and talented as they were.</p>
                
                <p>Despite its hard work and dedication, Frog the Jam was often overlooked and underestimated by its opponents. They saw it as nothing more than a freak of nature, and they often underestimated its true power.</p>
                
                <p>But Frog the Jam refused to let this discrimination hold it back. It knew that it was a powerful and formidable monster, and it was determined to prove it.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, Frog the Jam had had enough. It challenged the top monster card to a match, determined to prove once and for all that it was just as skilled and talented as any other card.</p>
                
                <p>The match was intense and fierce, with Frog the Jam using its slimy tentacles to great effect. In the end, it emerged victorious, defeating the top monster card and becoming the undisputed champion of the card game world.</p>
                
                <p>The other frogs were stunned and humbled by Frog the Jam's victory. They realized that they had been wrong to discriminate against the creature, and they finally accepted it as one of their own.</p>
                
                <p>From that day on, Frog the Jam was celebrated as a hero and a champion. It had overcome discrimination and proven itself as one of the greatest monster cards of all time. And though it was still a slimy, green blob with a frog's head and long, spindly arms, it was finally accepted and loved by all.</p>
                
                <p>After its victory, Frog the Jam became a hero and a champion in the world of card games. It was finally accepted and loved by all of the other frogs, and its name became synonymous with strength and power.</p>
                
                <p>However, despite its newfound fame and respect, Frog the Jam knew that it would always be remembered as the strange and unusual creature that it was. It was still a slimy, green blob with a frog's head and long, spindly arms, and it knew that it would always stand out from the other frogs.</p>
                
                <p>But Frog the Jam didn't let this bother it. It was proud of who it was and what it had accomplished, and it knew that it had earned its place in the world.</p>
                
                <p>As time passed, Frog the Jam's fame continued to grow. Its name became known throughout the land, and it was hailed as one of the greatest monsters of all time.</p>
                
                <p>However, as its fame grew, Frog the Jam began to feel a sense of responsibility to represent all slime creatures. It wanted to be a role model and inspire other slime creatures to be proud of who they were and to never let discrimination hold them back.</p>
                
                <p>With this in mind, Frog the Jam decided to change its name to &quot;Slime Toad.&quot; It wanted to honor its slimy heritage and embrace its unique and unusual appearance.</p>
                
                <p>The other frogs were initially hesitant to accept the change, but they eventually came around. They knew that Frog the Jam had always been a hero and a champion, and they knew that it would always be respected and loved no matter what it was called.</p>
                
                <p>And so, Slime Toad became the new name of the hero and champion. It was a symbol of strength, courage, and determination, and it would always be remembered as one of the greatest monsters of all time. The end</p>
